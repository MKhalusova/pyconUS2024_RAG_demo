      "\n",
      "The short answer: The sky appears blue because of the way that light interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in our atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they don't scatter all wavelengths of light equally. Instead, they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century. The scattering effect is greater for shorter wavelengths because these molecules are much smaller compared to the wavelength of light. As a result, the blue and violet colors are scattered more than the longer wavelengths like red and orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look at the sky, our eyes see the combined light from all directions, which has been scattered by these tiny molecules. The blue color dominates because it's been scattered more, giving the sky its characteristic blue hue during the daytime. At sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower in the sky, the light has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, which scatters even more of the shorter wavelengths, making the sky appear more red or orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: The sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in our atmosphere, with shorter (blue) wavelengths being scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n"
